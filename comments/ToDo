Major Bugs
------------
* ConfigurationPanel opens only once (thread?) -> DONE.
* After the annotator is canceled, an annotation job cannot be restarted (JDK > 1.6.15) -> DONE
* Annotation process never returns any results (JDK > 1.6.15) -> DONE
* Closing the HMMer2 local service closes angstd ->


- Wizard background ()
- tooltips
- test 4 internet connection, e.g. species tree
- sequence parser: not sure => pop up
- import project (overwrite)
- Export view in main menu => chooser
- new dataset: filebox length minimum size
- forbid same names within the workspace => overwrite rename
- show allowed formats in wizards sidebar 
- annotator: put default email also in options
- annotator: no resize
- annotator: kick evlue
- kick hmmer2 completly
- default email
- Show configuration action (works only once)
- Help: About, Manual
- check show inner nodes and collapse
- change small example dataset raw data into distance > 0 
- note bug: mark
- add align function to domainview
- before creating domain tree deselect all domains, nodes
- domain composition dialog layout: restore buton
- log file
- domain composition editor: from and to integer limits
- compare domain sequences => when changing reference arangement reset the hole manager



Current ToDos:
--------------
- pfam clan mapping
	=> options menu: show clans
	=> how to retrieve the clan?
- notes for arrangements
	=> show notes for tree nodes
	=> keep note information when exporting
	=> keep note information when creating domain tree
	=> optional mouse over on notes


Topics for next meeting:
-----------------------
- menu structure
- options menu
- basic and advanced mode (viewer, editor, analysis) (binaries)
- JNLP
	=> Load with online resources
- intro video
- manual
- window sizes
- platform independency


Andrews stuff:
--------------
- create species tree from sequence (interface ncbi)
- blast

Additional stuff:
-----------------
- (w8 for Hmmer3): cleaning of Andrews HMMER2 interface code and finish it. (take hmmer output as exceptable input format for domain view)
- standalone for hmmer2
- dotplot:all vs all => gray bar, percentage, option
- weights for sankoff and alignment
